## Information security in supplier relationships

### Requirements in contracts

In case of outsourcing services, security requirements concerning Human Resources must be part of the supplier contract in accordance with business requirements (including customer agreements), classification of the information to be accessed and the perceived risks. In case of outsourcing to other countries, the requirements must be in accordance with relevant local laws and regulations.

### Supplier compliance with relevant requirements

Suppliers must comply with all relevant requirements in the {{companys}} Security Policy.

### Determine impact

For each service must be determined whether it has potential security and/or continuity impact. If the service has no potential security and continuity impact, the requirements to this rationale are not applicable.

### Determine profile(s)

A service (or cluster of services) must be assigned profiles using the Requirement Selection Tool and a rationale for (not) selecting a profile must be included.

### Deployment of the Security Annex as part of the contract

All relevant requirements must, together with possible alternative requirements, be included in the Security Annex of the contract. This annex is part of the supplier contract.

### Alternative requirement setting

Any alternative requirement must ensure a security/continuity level as high as the original requirement.

### Select requirements for suppliers

Requirements must be selected by using document {{requirement_selection_document}}.

## Supplier service delivery management

### Consultation

### Assurance
