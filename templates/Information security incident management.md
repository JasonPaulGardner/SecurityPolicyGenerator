# Information security incident management

## Management of information security incidents and improvements

### Proactively detecting disruptions

A failure or performance degradation in systems, networks and services must be detected as soon as possible to the actual time of disruption.

### Setting the maximum number of  customers affected by mass disruption

The impact of a critical service must be limited to a maximum of {{number_of_customers}} customers per incident in the {{companys}} domain. Design and implementation should be adequate to the extent that with an incident, the impact is never larger than {{number_of_customers}} customers, unless there is a near-realtime switch to a redundant element with adequate capacity.


### Mass disruption (specific)

If an element of the service has a Single Point of Failure, then no more than {{number_of_customers_single_point}} customers are allowed on this element.

### The examination of security, safety and integrity incidents

Security, safety and integrity incidents are investigated in a uniform and objective manner. The examination by designated officials is necessary to maintain trust in the quality, integrity and results of an investigation.

This rationale governs the way in which security incidents are managed within {{company}} to ensure that:
- Security events can be detected and dealt with effectively.
- Identified security incidents are assessed and responded to in the most appropriate and efficient manner.
- The impact of security incidents on {{company}} and its business operations can be minimized by appropriate safeguards as part of the incident response.
- Lessons can be learned from security incidents and their management.

###  Reporting security incidents

Security incidents within {{company}} must be reported to one central contact point.
This makes {{company}} able to react adequately and limits damage for (customers of) {{company}} as much as possible.

### Provision of information

In case of criminal behavior and/or incidents, recorded information (images) may be given to:
• The {{companys}} Security Integrity Consultant;
• The police (in case {{company}} reports a criminal offence).

After receipt of an order or authorization, recorded information can only be given in the context of a legal investigation by or on behalf of the {{companys}} CSO to:
• A police officer;
• The public prosecutor;
• The examining magistrat

### Investigation of security and safety incidents

Line management must not investigate security incidents. Investigations can only be carried out or coordinated by {{companys}} security division or by designated ‘incident handlers’.

Safety incident analyses are being carried out by line management. If necessary further research will be conducted by the {{companys}} security division.

To ensure an uniform and objective way of incident handling.
Security incidents (i.e. stolen mobile phones, fraud, misuse) are being investigated by {{companys}} security division and incident handlers in segments.

Compliance Incidents are being investigated by compliance officers.

### Investigation of integrity incidents

All {{companys}} business units must follow {{companys}} Protocol for Integrity Investigations.
The Protocol describes requirements to ensure objectivity in conducting integrity investigations and to protect rights of {{company}} employees and external staff in case of an investigation. The Protocol governs the way in which integrity investigations are conducted and has been ratified by the Managing Board following due consultation with the Central Works Council. The Protocol is part of {{companys}} Framework of Code of Conduct and sub codes.
Only {{companys}} Security Integrity Consultants are authorized to conduct an integrity investigation.

To ensure objectivity in conducting investigations and incident handling.
An integrity investigation can be concerned with the facts and circumstances surrounding an alleged offence or malfeasance or any other alleged form of undesirable conduct on the part of the person under investigation, where his or her actions may harm the interests and reputation of {{company}}.

### Reporting loss or theft

A loss or theft of End User Devices and/ or removable media must be reported to {{companys}} security division

{{company}} must know what happens with {{companys}} physical and logical assets and to ensure that the right steps can be taken to minimize damage caused by the loss of information. There is a legal obligation to report data breach to supervisory authority and data-subjects.

### Reporting security and safety incidents

All employees, contractors, suppliers and third party users must report any security and safety event and weakness that might have an impact on the security of organizational assets and services of clients immediately to the {{companys}} Helpdesk Security, Compliance & Integrity.

Goal is to ensure that timely and corrective action can be taken on reported incidents and to minimize damage for {{company}} and {{companys}} clients. Therefore it is essential to have in place a structured well planned approach to the management of security incidents.

### Investigation of information security incidents

Information security incidents must be reported at the {{companys}} Helpdesk Security, Compliance & Integrity. The Helpdesk registers the incident and will forward it to {{companys}} Computer Emergency Response Team (in copy to the Senior Security Officer concerned) for further investigation.

The goal is to ensure an uniform and objective way of incident handling.
Information security incidents are mostly IT-related, i.e. using malware, hacking, viruses, using weak passwords.

### High risk information security incident

When security incidents occur with a high risk on infringement of integrity, confidentiality or availability of {{companys}} services, systems and information, or when a security incident exceeds more than one segment, an overarching process must be used (the so-called Security Be Alert process).

 The handling of an information security incident should take place according to this process if one of the following criteria are met:
• Media attention following the incident is possible or likely;
• Customer damage and/or damage caused by loss of income as a result of the incident is possible;
• Declaration on the occasion of the incident may be necessary;
• The incident is a violation of existing legislation.

In addition, CISO sees an opportunity to start this process.

The right resources and sufficient capacity must be made available at the time an information security incident involving a big impact and extent occurs. The handling of such an incident must be effective and be implemented in the shortest possible time.

i.e. Hack of a system environment, Denial-of-service attack (dos attack), etc

### Remotely Erase {{companys}} data at a loss

An end user device must be wiped (erased remotely) at loss or theft as soon as possible.

To avoid misuse of data. Disk encryption is no substitution for wiping as encryption often works with a key that is unlocked using the correct password. Nonetheless, many wipe mechanisms (e.g. iOS) do implement a ‘quick wipe’ in which the key is securely wiped, thereby making it more difficult for an attacker to decrypt the data.

Devices which can’t be reached, because there is no connection. It shall be kept in mind that remote wipe actions must use a retry mechanism to increase success factor.

### Abuse Handling

The owner of an asset must be connected to the process of the {{abuse_desk_service_name}}. Therefore access to systems containing customer- and contact details is needed, and tooling to block/unblock a service.

Abuse incidents can result in internal disruptions and external parties can impose sanctions against {{company}}, like Blacklisting.

Access can for example be given to systems like CSA/Siebel. Within these applications the Abusedesk is able to block/unblock a service, or a separate tool used for this.

For internal assets the managing party applies the blocking/unblocking, not the {{abuse_desk_service_name}}.

### Access to systems containing customer- and contact details

{{abuse_desk_service_name}} must have access to systems which, based on date, time and IP address, can give the translation to the proper customer/service and also give the contact details of the customer.

### Access to tooling to block/unblock services

{{abuse_desk_service_name}} must have access to systems which can block/unblock the service of a customer.
